# DH-project
**Here is a Python-3 code, which extracts all citations from a collection of articles and makes extracted material ready for Gephy.**

We are currently using a collection of articles from [Dialogue conference](http://www.dialog-21.ru/).
It consists of 1748 articles in Russian and English, mostly in FUCKING PDF format.

So far, Russian PDF-files can't be read by this programme (*pyPDF2 is really bad at it*).
